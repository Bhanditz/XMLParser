If any bugs or promotion ideas, feel free to contact to my email above.

Don't forget to add option -std=c++11 when you compiling.

class XMLNode:
	This class is used to mark down the info of each wrap tag. Here two pointers are used to 
	set up the structure, the next_level points to the next level of internal tags, can be regarded 
	as horizonal direction, the next_node points to the next peer of tag, can be regarded as vertical
	direction. The last level of tags will be regarded as attributes in the previous level node and 
	stored in as <key, value> in the unordered_map.

class XMLParser:
	This class is the main interface to deal with the XML file and extract the relevant infomation.
	XMLParser::XMLParser() can preprocess the XML file and produce the structure mentioned above.
	Then according to the structure, the caller function can iterate the nodes to get the info needed.

	<I will write a elegant iterator later for convenient using>		

class parseException:
	For the xml parsing and the xml file exception tracking.
